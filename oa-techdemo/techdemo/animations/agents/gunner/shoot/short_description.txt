Hello fellow game creator!

Here's a short description for the animation.

Frame 1 of each direction is the standing frame.
If you create a running animation you don't need frame 4 and 7. 
Blender calculated them but they are not really essential. 

Its possible to create a burst shot animation if the frames 6,8,9,10 are recurred. 

I hope it helps you a little bit.
