production_lines:
assigns production lines to buildings

res_storage:
defines a `resource` and it's `storage_size`. this is used in `production_ratio` for produced resources as well as consumated resources.

production_time:
defines how long it takes to produce a `resource` in `time`. create a dataset for every line of production, to keep it changeable.

production_ratio:
here we save how many resources X (`consumation`) are needed to produce 1 resource Y (`production`) in `ratio`. `consumation` and `production` are referenzes to the `rowid` in `res_storage`.
the primary key is a combination of `production`, `consumation`, and `production_line`.
an important but subtle fact is, that this is the only connection between production and consumation. if it takes res 'a' and 'b' to produce 'c', do it like this (with the corresponding datasets in `res_storage`, e.g. 'a' has to have `rowid`==1, b=2,  and so on):
production | consumation | ratio | production_line
3            1             1       1
3            2             1       1
