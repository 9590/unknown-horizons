README
======

All translations are handled through pootle [1] and the .po files in this
directory should only be touched when syncing with pootle (which should happen
regularly so users of the Git repository can test the translations).

[1]: http://pootle.unknown-horizons.org/

To update unknown-horizons.pot run

    ./development/create_pot.sh

If the .po files should also be updated run

    ./development/create_pot.sh -u
